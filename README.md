**GreenFuture BioChem: Integrated Profitability and Sustainability Analysis**

This project delivers a full analytical assessment of GreenFuture BioChem’s 2025 performance across Sales, Manufacturing, R&D, and Supply Chain operations. Using multiple datasets and an interconnected KPI dashboard suite, the analysis identifies how the company can improve profitability while advancing its sustainability mission.

The final output includes three executive dashboards:

Sales KPI Snapshot
Manufacturing KPI Snapshot
Supply Chain Sustainability Snapshot

These dashboards highlight opportunities, efficiency gaps, and sustainability trade-offs across the business.

**Features**

Unified analysis across **four datasets**: Sales Pipeline, Manufacturing Production, R&D Pipeline, and Supply Chain Procurement
Clear KPI tracking for revenue, win rate, manufacturing yield, cost variance, emissions, and supplier performance
Supplier Sustainability Index (SSI) for long-term procurement strategy
CO₂ avoided per dollar of procurement shift model
Category-level and plant-level profitability diagnostics
Tableau dashboards designed for leadership decision-making

**Dashboards**

**1. Sales KPI Snapshot**

*(SALES.png)*
This dashboard visualizes:

Active opportunities
Closed-win rate
Estimated vs. actual revenue
Closed-won revenue by category
Forecasted revenue through 2028
Top brands by weighted revenue

It reveals strong performance in Industrial Lubricants and Automotive Solutions and identifies weak conversion in Consumer & Home Care.

**2. Manufacturing KPI Snapshot**

*(MANUFACTURING.png)*
This dashboard tracks:

Production yield rate
Cost variance across plants
Monthly output by category
Manufacturing cost per MT

Key insights include:

Germany and Brazil show the strongest production performance but higher cost variance
China and the US experience lower yields
Specialty Polymers has the highest average manufacturing cost per MT

**3. Supply Chain Sustainability Snapshot**

*(SUPPLY CHAIN.png)*
This dashboard provides:

Total CO₂ emissions and total supply cost
Supplier delivery rates, quantity, cost, and emissions
Supplier Sustainability Index (SSI)
Raw material emissions vs. unit cost
Cost trends by raw material

Major findings:

Algae Oil, Cassava Starch, and Corn Starch are low-cost but high-emission materials
Wood Pulp and Soy Protein Extract offer lower emissions but higher costs
A targeted 10 percent supplier reallocation can save **$257K** and avoid **~710K tons of CO₂** annually

**Key Insights**

**Sales and Profitability**

$7.13B revenue and $1.12B profit YTD 2025
Win rate improved to ~33 percent by October
Industrial Lubricants and Automotive Solutions drive the majority of revenue

**Manufacturing Efficiency**

Avg yield: 92.58 percent
Brazil and Germany are most efficient but show high cost variance
High manufacturing cost in Specialty Polymers limits margin potential

**R&D Strategy**

Heavy concentration on Lubricants and Home Care
Underinvestment in high-growth categories such as Specialty Polymers and Automotive Solutions

**Supply Chain & Sustainability**

Clear trade-off: low-cost materials tend to have higher CO₂ emissions
Supplier relationships heavily concentrated in Brazil, Malaysia, India, and Indonesia
SSI provides a balanced framework for selecting sustainable, cost-effective suppliers

**Recommended Strategies**

**Short Run (0–12 months)**

Reallocate 10 percent of material volume to greener, cost-effective suppliers
Improve Home Care pitching to increase its low win rate
Prioritize high-probability deals in Lubricants and Automotive Solutions

**Long Run (1–3 years)**

Diversify regional sourcing to reduce transport emissions
Accelerate R&D in Specialty Polymers to reduce manufacturing cost
Implement Green Procurement KPIs:

CO₂ per $1M purchased
Supplier Sustainability Index (SSI)

**Conclusion**

GreenFuture BioChem can meaningfully enhance both profitability and sustainability by shifting to greener suppliers, rebalancing R&D focus, and strengthening manufacturing efficiency. 
The integrated dashboards provide a real-time, decision-ready view of where the biggest improvements can be made.
